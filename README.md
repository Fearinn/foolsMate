## :dart: Motivation

- Personal: Wolvesville means a lot for me as a game. As a player from beta, I saw it growing and evolving, even thought I was not always active. When they release a public API, I couldn't mwaste the opportunity to build something for a game and a community I love.

- Profissional: I always wanted to build a project in a "wiki" format, with which people could easily find useful info for something they like or need. I could apply recently acquired knowledge in both front and [back-end](https://github.com/Fearinn/wolvesvilleWikiAPI).

## :hammer: Pending improvements

- Add pages for all collectibles;
- Add pages for user and clan info.

## :handshake: How to help?

Feel free to open an issue in GitHub or to reach me directly with any suggestion or feedback. Sharing the deploy is also welcome (remember it's still far from finished thought).
